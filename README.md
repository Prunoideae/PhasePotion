# Phase Potion

## 0. Overview

This is a mod that can lift you out of your infinite pain and sorrow when breaking half your chunked machines and pipes, just to configure a single Thermal Dynamics servo or something like that, and having to placed them back to where it originally to be.

The mod added a simple yet strong potion - Phase Potion, it can cancel your hitbox when you are flying around, so you can just shift into the very narrow side of your machines and pipes, without breaking anything, or halting the complex's processing.

## 1. Things that I think you will ask frequently

### 1.1 Balance?

I don't think there's a need to tweak anything here, since :

1. You CAN modify the potion brewing by using CraftTweaker or something, which has a very robust support rather than I write a some config option for you.
2. The mod is "Imbalanced" or not is fully depending on your thought of the mod, for my own perspective, this potion is only used for shift through that shitty pipe setups and save my precious time, you CAN of course use this to glitch thorough caves, ravines to mine, or find dungeons much more easier, but that is always depends on how you play your game.

### 1.2 Why no clipping only when flying?

If I set the clipping when you are not flying, then you will be affected by the gravity, and go straightly down to the void, get killed, and lose all your items, you will always need somewhere to stand when you are not flying, since flying only above 1 block higher is rather strange. So please have a mod that can do "creative" flying, for example Botania.

## 2. Permissions

Things you can and can't do are listed below.

All permissions have one common principle : If you ask me via any form of communication about the permission listed below without having actually read it, or you have read it, without anything that I think worth noticing. Which will always make me feeling like you are a ignorant jerk, then you automatically lose all the permission below.

You can :

1. Modify the code and recompile and play a modified version (with your friends), if you are sure that it will never be released to public, without my permission, if you think that your server will have such a risk (e.g. a semi-public server), please ask me before you really do.
2. Include this in any form of the modpacks, and redistribute the original version of the code to public without modifying any binaries.
3. Repost the original copy of mod to other safe sites while keeping my credits. If you feeling like you want to repost somewhere unsafe, please don't.
4. Use this idea in your mod, if you do, please let me know, and if your mod is famous enough, I will then stop maintaining this repository.

You can't:

1. Redistribute the modified version of mod without crediting my name.
2. Blocking the access to this potion effect to common players via any method, or setting a unreasonable high price to use this, to make it commercial.

You can contact things that are not listed above with my via CurseForge, GitHub or even my e-mail, but if you spammed about anything listed above without a clear and strong prove that I really need change the licence, sorry, we are done.
